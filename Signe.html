            <p>Signe is the latest developer to join the team, she has recently graduated from university with a degree in web development. When asked to describe herself in one sentence she said "erm I don't know, swag" which is a good quote as she is always indecisive.

                <br>Signe has worked on a few big projects but with her being so new to the team they are yet to be completed and so we cannot reveal what they are.
